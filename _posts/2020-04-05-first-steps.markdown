A lot of the start of this project has just been working out if what I want to do will be possible with the tools available to me! Those tools are, namely, the standard HTML canvas, and whatever Javascript I can write.

One of the big frustrations about previous game jams I've participated in has been distributing the final product. I've made two things in Python, one with an game engine and one without, and it really seems like the only people who will be able to play it are people who already have Python installed. That's really limiting, especially for my non-techy friends and family! I've worked in Unity with other people, but right now that feels a bit heavy-weight for what I'm imagining, especially when I don't really know how the distribution parts of Unity work!

I've been interested in trying to make websites since I was around 10, but it was only recently that I realised how useful they would be for distribution, especially if the game can be played directly from the website! Unfortunately, it's always seemed like working with websites in conjunction with games was either going to be expensive, or complicated. I don't want to be charging money for these little games, so me having to pay for people to play them felt like a bit of a joke. Heroku ended up being too complicated for me to make any headway with. When I discovered GitHub Pages, it felt like the first time it could actually be free and easy!

So far, I've proven to myself that I can draw pictures (useful for my backgrounds) and run scripts (useful for... everything), so I'm at least satisfied that *something* will be possible!
