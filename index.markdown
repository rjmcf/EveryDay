"Every Day" is an HTML game made for the [Phoenix Isolation Jam][iso-jam] which ends May 31st, so it's still in the very early stages of development!

All art is placeholder and will eventually be replaced.

You can check out the current state of the [game][game-page], or see my [dev log][dev-log-page], which gives updates on my progress.
